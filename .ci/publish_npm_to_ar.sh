# Publishes the six @toolbox-sdk npm packages (5 platform-specific + 1 wrapper)
# to the OSS Exit Gate internal Artifact Registry. The Exit Gate then ships
# them externally to npmjs.org once trigger_exit_gate.sh uploads the manifest.
#
# Required CWD: repo root (so npm/server-*/ paths resolve).
#
# Binaries (toolbox.<os>.<arch>) are picked up from the workspace if present
# (versioned-release pipeline) and otherwise downloaded by each package's own
# prepack script from GCS by version (retry pipeline).
#
# Each publish is gated by an "already in AR?" check so the script is safe to
# re-run after a partial failure.
