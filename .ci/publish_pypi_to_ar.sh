# Builds one toolbox-server wheel per supported platform and uploads them all
# to the OSS Exit Gate internal Artifact Registry. Exit Gate ships them
# externally to pypi.org once trigger_exit_gate.sh uploads the manifest.
#
# Required CWD: repo root.
#
# Binaries (toolbox.<os>.<arch>) must be pre-staged in the workspace by an
# earlier Cloud Build step. The retry pipeline downloads them from GCS first.
#
# AR doesn't support twine's `--skip-existing` flag. If this version already
# has wheels in AR (e.g., from a prior run where Exit Gate failed to externally
# publish and left the AR contents in place), twine will error. Manually clean
# the AR version before re-running:
#
#   gcloud artifacts versions delete <VERSION> \
#     --package=toolbox-server \
#     --repository=mcp-toolbox--pypi \
#     --location=us \
#     --project=oss-exit-gate-prod
