## About

A `dataplex-get-operation` tool retrieves the status of a Dataplex long-running operation (LRO) like scan creation.

Poll this tool until the `done` field from the response is `true`. Once completed, the `response` field will contain the created DataScan resource, from which you can extract the `scanId` (the last part of the `name` field, e.g. `nq-doc-1234`) to pass to `get_run_status` and get results.
WARNING: This only tracks the creation of the scan template, NOT the actual background execution.

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Knowledge Catalog uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Knowledge Catalog resources. Toolbox will use your
[Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when
interacting with [Knowledge Catalog][dataplex-docs].

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for the tasks you
intend to perform. See [Knowledge Catalog IAM permissions][iam-permissions]
and [Knowledge Catalog IAM roles][iam-roles] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.
