entries are filtered and returned to the user. It also optionally accepts
following parameters:

- `databaseIds` - The IDs of the spanner database.

## Requirements

### IAM Permissions

Spanner uses [Identity and Access Management (IAM)][iam-overview] to control
user and group access to Knowledge Catalog (formerly known as Dataplex) resources. Toolbox will use your
[Application Default Credentials (ADC)][adc] to authorize and authenticate when
interacting with [Knowledge Catalog][dataplex-docs].

In addition to [setting the ADC for your server][set-adc], you need to ensure
the IAM identity has been given the correct IAM permissions for the tasks you
intend to perform. See [Knowledge Catalog IAM permissions][iam-permissions]
and [Knowledge Catalog IAM roles][iam-roles] for more information on
applying IAM permissions and roles to an identity.
